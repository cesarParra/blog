I very long time ago in what feels like a different life,
I came across some good recommendations on unit testing that I wanted to share with my team, and now I'm sharing here publicly.
The following are **direct quotes** from the [Software Engineering at Google, Unit Testing](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/ch12.html)
chapter book, with my own emphasis and commentary to tie it back to the work that Salesforce developers do,
and using Apex as the language of choice.

## Make Your Tests Complete and Concise

Two high-level properties that help tests achieve clarity are **completeness and conciseness**. A test is *complete* when
its body contains all of the information a reader needs in order to understand how it arrives at its result. A test is
*concise* when it contains no other distracting or irrelevant information. the following shows a test that is **neither
complete nor concise**:

```apex
@IsTest
public static void shouldPerformAddition() {
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator(new RoundingStrategy(),
        'unused', ENABLE_COSINE_FEATURE, 0.01, calculusEngine, false);
    Integer result = calculator.calculate(newTestCalculation());
    System.assertEquals(5, result);// Where did this number come from?
}
```

The test is passing a lot of irrelevant information into the constructor, and the actual important parts of the test are
hidden inside a helper method. The test can be made more complete by clarifying the inputs of the helper method, and
more concise by using another helper to hide the irrelevant details of constructing the calculator:

```apex
@IsTest
public static void shouldPerformAddition() {
    Calculator calculator = newCalculator();
    Integer result = calculator.calculate(
        newCalculation(2, Operation.PLUS, 3));
    System.assertEquals(5, result);
}
```

Notice that not literally everything needs to be on the test method. Using helper methods is totally fine as long as we
don’t lose the context of what is happening.

Not only that but helper methods also help hide the unnecessary complexity that is not needed for some particular tests.

## Test Behaviors, Not Methods

The first instinct of many engineers is to try to match the structure of their tests to the structure of their code such
that every production method has a corresponding test method.**This pattern can be convenient at first, but over time it
leads to problems**: as the method being tested grows more complex, its test also grows in complexity and becomes more
difficult to reason about. For example, consider the following snippet of code, which displays the results of a
transaction.

```apex
public void displayTransactionResults(User user, Transaction transaction) {
    ui.addMessage('You bought a ' + transaction.getItemName());
    if (user.getBalance() < LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD) {
        ui.addMessage('Warning: your balance is low!');
    }
}
```

It wouldn’t be uncommon to find a test covering both of the messages that might be shown by the method, as presented
here:

```apex
@IsTest
public static void testDisplayTransactionResults() {
    transactionProcessor.displayTransactionResults(
            newUserWithBalance(LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD.plus(dollars(2))),
            new Transaction('Some Item', dollars(3)));

    System.assert(ui.getText().contains('You bought a Some Item'));
    System.assert(ui.getText().contains('your balance is low'));
}

```

With such tests, it’s likely that the test started out covering only the first method. Later an engineer expanded the
test when the second message was added (violating the idea of unchanging tests that we discussed earlier). This
modification sets a bad precedent: **as the method under test becomes more complex and implements more functionality,
its unit test will become increasingly convoluted and grow more and more difficult to work with.**

The problem is that framing tests around methods can naturally encourage unclear tests because a single method often
does a few different things under the hood and might have several tricky edge and corner cases. There’s a better way:
rather than writing a test for each method, write a test for each*behavior.*A behavior is any guarantee that a system
makes about how it will respond to a series of inputs while in a particular state. Behaviors can often be expressed
using the words [“given,” “when,” and “then”](https://oreil.ly/I9IvR). The previous example can be rewritten as follows:

```apex
@IsTest
public static void displayTransactionResults_showsItemName() {
    transactionProcessor.displayTransactionResults(
            new User(), new Transaction('Some Item'));
    System.assert(ui.getText().contains('You bought a Some Item'));
}

@IsTest
public void displayTransactionResults_showsLowBalanceWarning() {
    transactionProcessor.displayTransactionResults(
            newUserWithBalance(
                    LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD.plus(dollars(2))),
            new Transaction('Some Item', dollars(3)));
    System.assert(ui.getText().contains('your balance is low'));
}
```

Behavior-driven tests tend to be clearer than method-oriented tests for several reasons. First, they read more like
natural language. Second, they more clearly express cause and effect because each test is more limited in scope.
Finally, the fact that each test is short and descriptive makes it easier to see what functionality is already tested
and encourages engineers to add new streamlined test methods instead of piling onto existing methods.

## Don’t Put Logic in Tests

Clear tests are trivially correct upon inspection; that is, it is obvious that a test is doing the correct thing just
from glancing at it. This is possible in test code because each test needs to handle only a particular set of inputs,
whereas production code must be generalized to handle any input. For production code, we’re able to write tests that
ensure complex logic is correct. But test code doesn’t have that luxury—if you feel like you need to write a test to
verify your test, something has gone wrong!

Complexity is most often introduced in the form of *logic*. Logic is defined via the imperative parts of programming
languages such as operators, loops, and conditionals. When a piece of code contains logic, you need to do a bit of
mental computation to determine its result instead of just reading it off of the screen. It doesn’t take much logic to
make a test more difficult to reason about. For example, does this look right to you?

```apex
@IsTest
public static void shouldNavigateToAlbumsPage() {
    String baseUrl = '<http://photos.google.com/>';
    Navigator nav = new Navigator(baseUrl);
    nav.goToAlbumPage();
    System.assertEquals(nav.getCurrentUrl(), baseUrl + '/albums');
}
```

There’s not much logic here: really just one string concatenation. But if we simplify the test by removing that one bit
of logic, a bug immediately becomes clear, as demonstrated here:

```apex
@IsTest
public static void shouldNavigateToPhotosPage() {
    Navigator nav = new Navigator('<http://photos.google.com/>');
    nav.goToPhotosPage();
    System.assertEquals(nav.getCurrentUrl(), '<http://photos.google.com//albums>');// Oops!
}
```

When the whole string is written out, we can see right away that we’re expecting two slashes in the URL instead of just
one. If the production code made a similar mistake, this test would fail to detect a bug. Duplicating the base URL was a
small price to pay for making the test more descriptive and meaningful.

If humans are bad at spotting bugs from string concatenation, we’re even worse at spotting bugs that come from more
sophisticated programming constructs like loops and conditionals. The lesson is clear: in test code, stick to
straight-line code over clever logic, and consider tolerating some duplication when it makes the test more descriptive
and meaningful.
